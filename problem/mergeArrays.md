# Merge Arrays

given 3 sorted arrays, merge them into one array 
without modifying the original arrays. And eliminating 
the duplicated elements.
 
```
Example 1:

Input: 
A=[-100 ,-20,-10,0,30,40,90]
B=[-90,0,0,20,30]
C=[-50,-10,0,5,30,70,100]

Output: 
[-100, -90, -50, -20, -10, 0, 5, 20, 30, 40, 70, 90, 100]
```

Note:
```
1 <= n <= 100
The elements of the array are integers, and the 
array is sorted
-10000 <= array[i] <= 10000
```
